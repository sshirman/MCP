This directory contains the notebook required to run the code I created to analyze the path manifold for the PdU system

The actual "data" files which contain the time series for 51x51 parameter sets is too  large to attach here. I am including the link to my box folder that contains the data files

https://northwestern.box.com/s/rp8ggeo0j9h9a76fmsvrtfox7na4ufls

These files should be placed in a directory called "WildType" which is below the main directory in which the jupyter notebook is run.
